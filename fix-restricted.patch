 * The font files are all by Leon Marrick and/or Sheldon Simms III and/or Nick McConnell, all of whom have agreed to their Angband work being released under the GPL.
 
 It is considered good practice to retain this statement for derivatives, rather than (e.g.) redistributing Adam Bolt's tiles under the GPL, or choosing to make a variant which is only under one of the Angband or GPL licences.  This allows easier sharing of changes between variants.
